# Quest For Lubok

A text based game like those one would find in the early eighties. I'm rewriting my first game that I wrote as a kid all those years ago. This is just a fun little project that I'm writing it in QBASIC. It's just something I've been thinking about doing for quite sometime. THe original file format for QFL is that of .BAS which is the standard for Qbasic. As for what you see on here is just a plain text version. Which is easy to read and to understand. I will post when I have the time and will attempt to be frequent.

A Dialog port is also available (see the Dialog directory for the source, as well as compiled zmachine and web versions.
